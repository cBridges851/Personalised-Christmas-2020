## Motivation
I wanted to create virtual Christmas cards for friends, so I decided to put my A-Frame skills to the test and make a VR scene! This version requires the user to input their name when the page loads.

## Tech/Framework
This uses A-Frame, a framework that is used to create web VR scenes. This was created inside a HTML file. This project also uses JavaScript find the name in the URL and output it on the banner to replace the word "everyone".

## Installation
- This project is really easy to install if you wish to do so:
- Clone this repository `https://github.com/cBridges851/personalised-christmas-2020.git`
- Navigate to the files you wish to view. The HTML file where the A-Frame code is in the root folder.

## How To Use
- If you don't wish to download this onto your computer, you can simply view it here: https://cbridges851.github.io/Personalised-Christmas-2020/
- If you do have this on your computer, you can open index.html in your text editor and open it on a live server.
- When the page loads, input your name and press enter!
